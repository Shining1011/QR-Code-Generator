Problem Aimed to Solve:
The problem aimed to solve with this project, is to give access to a free, dynamic, working QR code generator 


Tasks:
 - GUI: a simple user interface with:
		- 2 togglable options data type and ecc 
		- textbox for user input
		- generate QR code button
		- image box to display the qr code
		- 2 togglable options for file format, and QR Size
		- download button
		- download bar
 - QR Code generation:
		- generating static characteristics of a qr code based on version, ecc, format, etc...
		- Taking user data and encoding based on its data type and ecc
		- generating redundant data for data loss level
		- Selecting correct qr version for size of user data up to version 10
		- inserting encoded user data and redundant data into QR code
		- adding mask to QR Code
 - Image creation: 
		- using qr code matrix to generate an rgb image of certain size (example: 296x296, 512x512)
		- converting qr code to intended file format
 - User Download:
		- download complete qr code to users downloads folder when prompted
		

Inputs:
 - data type: numeric, alphanumeric, byte, kanji
 - error correction capability: L = 7%, M = 15%, Q = 25%, H = 30%
 - data: Minimum 1 byte, Maximum version 10 L QR

Outputs:
 - scannable QR

Data Types:
 	- class for qr code which takes in: 
				- value of data type of float, string, bytes
				- data type as an enum, 
				- and ecc as an Enum
	- The QR code values will be held a 2 dimensional Boolean array
